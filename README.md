## Getting started

### Install dependencies
To install app dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

### Compile to zip
To compile the app to a .zip file:

```
yarn run zip
```

### Start dev server
To start the webpack development server:

```
yarn start
```

By default, webpack will start on port 8081, and assumes DHIS2 is running on 
http://localhost:8080/dhis with `admin:district` as the user and password.

A different DHIS2 instance can be used to develop against by setting the `DHIS2_HOME`
environmental variable (e.g. `export DHIS2_HOME=/Users/Olav/dhis2/epi_home`). 
Inside the folder `DHIS2_HOME` points to, create a file `config` with the url 
and base64-encoded username:password like this:

```
exports.baseUrl = 'http://localhost:8090/epidev';
exports.authorization = 'Basic YWRtaW46ZGlzdHJpY3QK='; //Based64 encoded
```
